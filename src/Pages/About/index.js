            Born in PerÃº {Age} years ago. Moved to Chile a year after that. Then
            back to PerÃº in 2014. And back to Chile again two years later. So
            here I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            I strive to design wonderful and accessible digital products that go
            unnoticed in day-to-day life, while staying true to their intended
            meaning. Currently doing that at Cornershop, a Uber-owned grocery
            delivery service that offers world-class digital products powered by
            software and design.
          </p>

            Studied Design at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile, and you
            know how it goes. Find more of that on my{" "}
